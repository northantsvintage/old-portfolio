                <p style="color:gray;font-size:14px;text-align:left;">"I highly recommend Aida Papic as a candidate for employment. Aida was responsible for the design, creation and maintenance of various in-house and external websites, graphical design and the themes of the web applications.<br>
Aida is a very bright and personable individual. She is highly self-motivated, well-organised, independent and more then capable of achieving any goal she sets her mind to. Aida's ability to quickly learn and take new responsibilities added tremendous value to our company. She learned new technologies promptly and incorporated them in her daily work.<br> Her co-workers also held her in high regard as a valuable resource, and looked to her for inovative design direction and advice. She has a great team ethic and was never affraid to offer advice and idea's to improve our design presence throughout our business acivites.
She is flexible and willing to work on any project that was assigned to her.<br> Aida was quick to learn. Aida was quick to volunteer to assist in other areas of company operations as well.
Aida would be tremendous asset for your company and has my highest recommendation.</p>
